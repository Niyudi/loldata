To use the code, you need to create a folder called "keys" with two files, "DB_URI" and "RIOT_API_KEY":

keys/
 |- DB_URI
 |- RIOT_API_KEY

In the "DB_URI" file, write the URI to connect to your PostgreSQL database. In the "RIOT_API_KEY", write your riot API
key.

To setup the database, run the "up" SQL scripts in the folder "migrations" in order. The file "config.py" has a few
configurable parameters for the search.
