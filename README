To use the code, you need to create a folder called "keys" with two files, "DB_URI" and "RIOT_API_KEY":

keys/
 |- DB_URI
 |- RIOT_API_KEY

In the "DB_URI" file, write the URI to connect to your PostgreSQL database. In the "RIOT_API_KEY", write your riot API
key.

To configure the database, run the "up" SQL scripts in the folder "migrations". For the search to begin, there must be
at least one player ranked emerald or above regsitered in the "players" table.
